# student-performance-analyzer
Python project to analyze student marks using pandas and Matplotlib.

Overview
The Student Performance Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis project that evaluates student marks from a CSV file.  
It calculates each student’s average marks, determines pass/fail results, identifies top performers, and visualizes the class performance using bar charts.  

This project demonstrates how data can be processed and visualized using Python’s pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
